Here is the code for a light chaser game I made. Random LEDs light up and one has to press the button associated with the lit-up LED as soon as possible. The difficulty level of this game keeps on increasing linearly with the score. It's been a surprisingly fun and addictive game with a very simple setup and code. 

The instructions for how to assemble this game with an OLED display are available here https://www.instructables.com/Light-Chaser-Game/
